Choosing Your Mobile Frontend: Expo and React Native

You've mentioned Expo, which means you'll be building your mobile app with React Native. This is an excellent choice because:

Cross-Platform: Write code once, deploy to both iOS and Android. This saves a huge amount of development time and effort.

JavaScript/TypeScript: Since your backend is Python, using JavaScript (with TypeScript for better type safety) for the frontend means your team can leverage similar programming paradigms and potentially share logic or understanding.

Expo's Tooling: Expo handles a lot of the complex native setup for you, making development faster, especially for features like push notifications, camera access, and location services. It provides a managed workflow that simplifies building, testing, and deploying.

2. How the Mobile App Talks to Your Backend: APIs

Your existing FastAPI backend is already set up as a RESTful API. This is perfect! The mobile app will communicate with your backend by making standard HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to your API endpoints.

Data Format: Your backend likely sends and receives data in JSON format, which is the standard for web and mobile applications. React Native apps are excellent at consuming and sending JSON data.

API Endpoints: You'll use your existing API endpoints for various actions. For example:

GET /students to fetch a list of students.

POST /auth/login to log a user in.

POST /attendance to submit attendance records.

3. Authentication on Mobile: JWT

Your backend uses JWT-based authentication. Here's how that typically works on the mobile side:

Login: When a user logs in from the mobile app, they send their credentials (e.g., username/password) to your POST /auth/login endpoint.

Token Reception: Your FastAPI backend will return a JWT (and potentially a refresh token).

Secure Storage: The mobile app must securely store this JWT. For React Native, you'd use a library like expo-secure-store which keeps sensitive data encrypted on the device.

Sending Tokens: For every subsequent API request that requires authentication, the mobile app will include the JWT in the Authorization header (e.g., Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN).

Refresh Tokens: If your JWTs have short expiration times, you'll also implement a refresh token mechanism. When the main JWT expires, the app uses the refresh token to get a new access token without requiring the user to log in again. This process also needs to be handled securely.

4. Translating Backend Modules into Mobile Features

Let's look at how your core backend modules translate into mobile app features:

School Management:

Mobile Feature: School search/selection during initial setup or registration. Displaying school-specific configurations (e.g., school name, logo).

Backend Interaction: GET /schools (for public schools or search), POST /schools/register (if you allow mobile registration), GET /schools/{school_id}/config.

User Management & Roles:

Mobile Feature: User profiles, ability for school admins to approve new users (if your workflow allows), displaying user-specific dashboards based on their role (student, teacher, admin).

Backend Interaction: GET /users/me (for current user profile), PUT /users/{user_id} (for profile updates), POST /users/register (with join code).

Student Management:

Mobile Feature: Student profiles (for parents/teachers), student lists, academic records, behavior reports.

Backend Interaction: GET /students, GET /students/{student_id}.

Teacher Management:

Mobile Feature: Teacher profiles, class assignments, subject assignments.

Backend Interaction: GET /teachers, GET /teachers/{teacher_id}.

Academic Management:

Mobile Feature: Viewing departments, classes, subjects, current sessions/terms.

Backend Interaction: GET /academic/classes, GET /academic/subjects.

Attendance System:

Mobile Feature:

For Teachers: Marking student attendance with location verification.

For Students: Viewing their attendance records.

For Parents: Viewing child's attendance.

Backend Interaction: POST /attendance (sending GPS data and student IDs), GET /attendance/my (for students), GET /attendance/class/{class_id} (for teachers).

Assessment & Grading:

Mobile Feature:

For Teachers: Entering scores for assessments, viewing grading components.

For Students/Parents: Viewing grades, assessment results.

Backend Interaction: GET /assessments, POST /assessments/{assessment_id}/scores, GET /grades/my.

Fee Management:

Mobile Feature: Viewing outstanding fees, payment history, initiating Paystack payments.

Backend Interaction: GET /fees/my, POST /payments/initiate (to get Paystack redirect/checkout URL).

Communication:

Mobile Feature: In-app messaging, behavior reporting forms.

Backend Interaction: POST /messages, GET /messages/inbox, POST /behavior-reports.

Timetable Management:

Mobile Feature: Viewing personalized timetables (student/teacher), class schedules.

Backend Interaction: GET /timetables/my, GET /timetables/class/{class_id}.

Admissions:

Mobile Feature: Application status tracking, document upload interface for applicants.

Backend Interaction: POST /applications, GET /applications/{app_id}, POST /applications/{app_id}/documents.

5. External Service Integrations on Mobile

Paystack Integration:

Your backend initiates the Paystack payment and provides a URL.

On mobile, you'll typically open this URL in a web browser component (like expo-web-browser or a WebView) for the user to complete the payment.

After payment, Paystack redirects back to a URL on your backend, which then updates your database. Your mobile app can then poll your backend or listen for a push notification to confirm the payment.

Location Services (GPS Verification):

The mobile app will need to request location permissions from the user (expo-location).

When a user marks attendance, the app will get their current GPS coordinates using expo-location.

These coordinates are then sent to your backend (POST /attendance), where your FastAPI logic performs the verification against authentic locations.

Push Notifications (FCM Integration):

Expo has excellent support for push notifications using FCM.

The mobile app will register for push notifications and get a device token (expo-notifications).

This device token must be sent to your backend and stored against the user's profile.

When your backend needs to send a notification (e.g., new message, fee reminder), it uses the stored FCM device token to send the notification via FCM. Expo then handles displaying it on the user's device.

File Management (Document Upload/Storage):

The mobile app will use libraries like expo-image-picker or expo-document-picker to allow users to select files (documents, images) from their device.

These files are then uploaded to your backend. You'll likely use multipart/form-data requests for file uploads, which FastAPI handles well.

Your backend then stores these files (e.g., on a cloud storage service and records the URL in PostgreSQL).

For viewing, the mobile app can display files directly if they are common types (images, PDFs) or open them using the device's default viewer (expo-linking for external URLs).

6. Mobile-Specific Considerations (UX & Performance)

User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX):

Responsive Design: Ensure your app's layout adapts well to different screen sizes and orientations (phones, tablets).

Navigation: Implement intuitive navigation (tabs, stack navigation, drawers) so users can easily move between sections.

Performance: Optimize API calls to fetch only necessary data, use pagination for lists, and implement loading states (spinners) to indicate data fetching.

Offline Support: While your current backend doesn't emphasize offline capabilities, for a better mobile experience, consider caching frequently accessed data locally on the device (e.g., using AsyncStorage or a local database like SQLite via expo-sqlite) so the app remains usable even without an internet connection for some features.

Error Handling: Clearly display user-friendly error messages if API calls fail or there are network issues.

Security:

Always use HTTPS for all API communication.

Never store sensitive user data (like passwords) directly on the device.

Properly validate all user input on both the frontend and backend.

7. Development Workflow with Expo

Expo Go App: Use the Expo Go app on your phone to quickly test your app during development by scanning a QR code from your development server.

Development Builds: For features that require native modules not included in Expo Go (e.g., complex background tasks), you'll create development builds of your app.

EAS Build/Submit: Expo Application Services (EAS) provides cloud-based services for building your app binaries (APK for Android, IPA for iOS) and submitting them to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

By focusing on consuming your existing RESTful API, leveraging Expo's tooling for native features, and keeping mobile UX in mind, you'll be well on your way to building a great mobile Education ERP app!
